Game i made to help a friend at my university.
The intent of this project is to gamefy the proccess of learning LIBRAS(LÃ­ngua Brasileira de Sinais) AKA Brazilian Sign Language.

Its a memory game where you have to match the image with it's respective hand sign.

Some implementations are required to make it perfect (there's a trick to always know where the pairs are), but it was good enough 
to it's objective so i'm not planning on doing it.

You can change the images as long you dont change the names, customize the way you want!
